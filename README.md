# ClockJx
ClockJx is a configurable watch face that has both digital and analog clocks. Different colors and settings on the display can be changed. There is also an option to use a skiing and mountain themed image in the background.

Always visible on the clock screen are:

- Current time in either analog or digital format.
- Current day and date.
- Battery status in percentages.

Optionally it is possible to show one or all of the following information on the clock face:

- Bluetooth connection status
- Current heart beat
- Daily step count
- Current altitude
- Dual time in digital format

Configuration options are:

- Analog or digital clock
- Digital time color
- Background color
- Foreground color
- Background image
- ClockJx default font or system font for digital time display
- Bluetooth status display
- Dual time and dual time daylight savings time offset
- Bigger dual time font size with analog clock when altitude is not displayed
- Low and critical battery warning levels
- Battery status background color.
- Analog 24 hour clock.
- Step count
- Current heart beat

Normally battery status is show with a green color. If battery goes below low battery warning level (default 25%) it is shown in orange color. If battery goes below critical battery warning level (default 10%) most other elements like analog watch face numbers and altitude and step count turn to red. The idea is that you should not miss a low battery status before going on a training.

If Bluetooth status is shown then an active connection is shown with a blue Bluetooth icon. If connection is not active it is shown with a red Bluetooth icon.
