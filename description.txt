ClockJx is a configurable watch face that has both digital and analog clocks. Both foreground and background colors can be changed. There is also an option to use a skiing and mountain themed image in the background.

It is possible to show one or all of the following information on the clock face:

- Daily step count
- Current altitude
- Dual time in digital format

Other configuration options are:

- Analog or digital clock
- Background color
- Foreground color
- Background image
- ClockJx default font or system font for digital time display
- Bluetooth status display

Always visible on the clock screen are:

- Current time in either analog or digital format.
- Battery status in percentages.
- Current day and date.

Normally battery status is show with a green color. If battery goes below 50% it is shown in red color. If battery goes below 25% also other elements like analog watch face numbers and altitude and step count turn to red. The idea is that you should not miss a low battery status before going on a training.

If bluetooth status is shown then an active connection is shown with a blue bluetooth icon. If connection is not active it is shown with a red bluetooth icon.

CONFIGURATION

Configuration works from a mobile phone or from Garmin express. You cannot configure directly from a Garmin device like you can do with a built in watch face. In the mobile phone you need to go to watch face section and select the installed ClockJx watch face. Then you can select settings and change them there. Configuration requires the Garmin device firmware with Connect IQ version 1.2.
